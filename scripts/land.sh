#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/land.sh — the only path to `main`.
#
# ## Why a script and not a paragraph
#
# There is no CI. Nothing on GitHub runs the gate, so the merge button computes a NEW merge commit at
# the instant of the click, against whatever `main` is then — a tree no gate has ever seen. That is
# worse here than in an ordinary repository for one specific reason: `scripts/corpus.manifest` is a
# whole-tree behaviour oracle, and so are the fixpoint and `idiom_gate.sh`. Two independently green
# pull requests can merge textually clean into a tree whose manifest matches NEITHER of them, and
# nothing would notice until someone ran the gate by hand, days and several merges later, bisecting to
# a merge commit rather than to a change.
#
# So: the object that is gated is the object that is published, by identity. Nothing is re-derived
# between the gate and the push.
#
# ## Why the phases are not chained
#
# A destructive action must never share an `&&` chain with its own verification. A failed fast-forward
# followed by a successful `git branch -D` once lost a lane's work, recovered only from dangling
# commits. `gh pr merge --delete-branch` is that same shape wearing a nicer name: a state change plus
# a deletion in one action, whose precondition is textual mergeability rather than a green gate. This
# script therefore prints a verdict between phases and stops; the push is a separate invocation and
# the branch deletion is a third, with `git merge-base --is-ancestor` as its own precondition.
#
# ## Usage
#
#   scripts/land.sh <pr-number>          prepare + gate the merge, print the push command, stop
#   scripts/land.sh <pr-number> --push   the same, then publish it if the gate was green
#
# Run it from the integration checkout, inside `nix develop` (or it re-enters via `nix develop -c`).
